# 📊 Food Delivery Data Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
I worked on analyzing food delivery data to identify key trends, optimize delivery times, and improve customer satisfaction. Using **data analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning**, I derived insights and provided recommendations for enhancing food delivery efficiency.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains details on food orders, customer ratings, restaurant performance, and delivery times. Key attributes include:
- **Order Information**: Order ID, Customer ID, Cost of Order, Cuisine Type, Day of the Week  
- **Customer Feedback**: Ratings  
- **Operational Metrics**: Food Preparation Time, Delivery Time

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations  
- **Scipy** for statistical analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning

## 📌 My Work in This Project

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values, such as replacing missing ratings with the average rating.  
- Converted numerical columns to the correct format for analysis.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized trends in order costs, delivery times, and customer ratings.  
- Analyzed the impact of food preparation time on delivery efficiency.  

### 3️⃣ Statistical Analysis  
- Conducted hypothesis testing to determine if order costs vary between weekdays and weekends.
- - Examined correlations between food preparation time and customer ratings.  

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Model  
- Developed a regression model to predict delivery times based on order cost and food preparation time.  
- Evaluated model performance using mean absolute error (MAE). 
- Examined correlations between food preparation time and customer ratings.
